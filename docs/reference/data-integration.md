## Integrating phenotype data using the uPheno framework

### Prerequisites

- [Familiarise yourself with the core concepts](../reference/core-concepts.md)
- [Familiarise the basics of phenotype data](../reference/phenotype-data.md)

### Level 1 integration: Data

Before we get started, let's remind ourselves of the basic structure of phenotype data.

![Core concepts](../images/core_concepts.png)

_Characteristics_ (A) and _bearers_ of characteristics (B) are the core constituents of traits/biological attributes (C). _Phenotypes_ are comprised of trait terms (C) combined with a modifier (D). Species-specific phenotypes (F), including _phenotypic abnormalities_ defined in the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) are feature of diseases (G). Measurements (H), such as assays, quantify or qualify (measure) traits (C).

Integrating all kinds of phenotype data into the "uPheno framework" is a complex process which we will break down in the following.



### Level 2 integration: Knowledge


#### Important relationships wrt to phenotype data

- inheres in / characteristic of
- bearer of
